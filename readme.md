# Start
This marks the start of my ultralearning project, I'm trying to learn ~4 years worth of high school math in 4 months. While it sounds kinda scary, it needs to be stated that during the 4 specified years of high school, you learn many more subjects than just math, and you probably dont use optimal learning strategies; also you're likely not highly motivated to learn math as it is something you are forced to do.

## Why
Math serves as the basis of most scientific subjects and lack of fundamental math knowledge gatekeeps me from learning, also, a certain level of math is required for academic studies, a level which I don't posses yet, and math courses take a long time, if I can self study math and use the techniques these courses use I can work on my self studying abillties while also improving a skill that critically needs improving.

## When
Project will start at the 12/01/2022 and will end[^1] at the 16.05.2022 (exam date).
I plan to study for 30 weekly hours spanned across the whole week.

| DAY         | Times                   | Total Hours| 
| ----------- | -----------             | -----------|
| Sunday      | 06:00 -> 07:00, 17:00 -> 20:00|    4   |
| Monday   | 06:00 -> 07:00, 18:00 -> 21:00        | 4 |
| Tuesday   | 06:00 -> 07:00, 17:00 -> 21:00 | 5 |
| Wednesday |  06:00 -> 07:00, 18:00 -> 21:00 | 4 |
| Thursday | 06:00 -> 07:00, 15:00 -> 20:00 | 6 |
| Friday | 06:00 -> 08:00, 10:00 -> 15:00 | 7 |
| Saturday| BREAK | N\A |
| Total| N\A | 30|

[^1]: Project will end but math journey might just begin.

## Study Plan:
Go through Brilliant's [Math Foundations](https://brilliant.org/paths/math-foundations/), and [Intermediate Math](https://brilliant.org/paths/intermediate-math/) paths.

Go through Yoel Geva books, And [HighGrades](https://highgrades.co.il/) Videos.
Go through practice exam every friday.
